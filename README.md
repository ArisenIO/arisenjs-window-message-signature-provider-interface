# ARISEN Signature Provider for Desktop Browsers

A [Signature Provider Interface](https://github.com/ARISENIO/arisen-signature-provider-interface) for communicating with an authenticator over the [Window Messaging API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) using the [ARISEN Authentication Transport Protocol Specification](https://github.com/ARISENIO/arisen-authentication-transport-protocol-spec).

## Overview

When plugged into `ARISENJS`, this signature provider enables desktop web applications to route signing requests to a browser extension authenticator. Full instructions for `ARISEN` can be found [here](https://github.com/arisenio/arisenjsv1).

## Installation

```bash
yarn add arisenjs-window-message-signature-provider-interface
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { Api, JsonRpc } from "ARISEN"
import { SignatureProvider } from "arisenjs-window-message-signature-provider-interface"

const rpc = new JsonRpc("RPC_ENDPOINT_HERE")
const signatureProvider = new SignatureProvider({
  declaredDomain: "YOUR_DOMAIN", // This domain must have a `chain-manifests.json` file at the root
  returnUrl: "YOUR_DOMAIN",
})
const api = new Api({
  rpc,
  signatureProvider,
})

api.transact(...)

```
